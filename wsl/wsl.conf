# Valid options with defaults:
# - metadata
#   Enable support for Linux metadata. The [ug]id and [ufd]mask options will be

# - case=off
#   Case-sensitivity handling for directories
#   off:    Disabled by default
#   dir:    Enabled by default for newly created directories
#   force:  Enabled unconditionally for all directories
#
#   For off & dir options the per-directory case-sensitivity behaviour is
#   controlled by the system.wsl_case_sensitive extended attribute.
#
#   The case-sensitivity EA can be queried and set using fsutil:
#   fsutil.exe file queryCaseSensitiveInfo <directory>
#   fsutil.exe file setCaseSensitiveInfo <directory> [enable|disable]
#
#   The legacy force option requires setting a registry key:
#   Path:   HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\lxss
#   Name:   DrvFsAllowForceCaseSensitivity
#   Type:   REG_DWORD
#   Value:  1
